            Hello, I'm Mohamed Yasser, an Egyptian software engineering student from Giza. <br>
            I am a very ambitious programmer with a strong desire to explore various forms of technology across multiple fields. <br>
            I dedicate myself to studying and working hard every day, with the hope that one day my contributions will be remembered and <br>
            that I will become a role model, not just for developers, but for people everywhere.

            I studied at different schools around Giza and Cairo. the last of them was Dar-El-Hanan in El-Haram.<br> 
            I finished high school in 2022 and got accepted into the faculty of engineering at Cairo University.<br> 
            I finished my preparatory year with excellent grades. in 2023, I started studying at the computer engineering department. <br>
            Hopefully, I will graduate in 2027 with great grades.

            graduated from high school with a remarkable score of 97.8%, which was considered high for my time.<br>
             I ranked 3rd in the Giza governorate and 34th among my peers nationwide that year. <br>
             I received numerous awards from various organizations and was offered several pre-paid scholarships,<br> 
             including one to Cairo University.

                This year, my team secured 2nd place at Helwan's IEEE Modifiers 8.0 competition for embedded systems.<br>
                Despite having no past knowledge of embedded systems, I quickly learned a lot in just one month.<br>
                The required task was intense, as we had to build a multifunctional RC car in only three days,<br>
                 but we successfully completed the task despite being the youngest team to compete.

        <p class="projects-intro"> I have worked on a decent amount of projects, both software and hardware based.<br>
            Here are some examples</p>

            <h3 class="project-title">smart street lighting system</h3>
            <p class="projects-info">
            It was a simple yet very useful and important project. Its main purpose is to reduse the energy consumed by street lights.<br> 
            the idea is that the street lights get completely turned off during the day. But, at night, it turns on with a lower brightness and it detects the motion of cars.<br> 
            when a car passes by, the lights turn on with maximum brightness

            <h3 class="project-title">Paint for kids</h3>
            <p class="projects-info">
            It's a C++ based drawing application for children. It has many features and a very interactive and fun GUI.<br>
            I am very proud of this project because it took a lot of individual and team effort to complete it.
